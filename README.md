# StrangePlayer Pro
**Strange Player Pro** is **free** and **best-in-class** music player. The problem with most music players is that the user can choose which music he/she wants to play - and that’s usually some *garbage*. With *StrangePlayer Pro* you have a few songs to chose from but they are **all awesome**. Isn’t it great?*



### Installation

Just download the `StrangePlayer.Pro.jar` from the latest release in [Releases](https://github.com/WellThatsStrange-Studios/StrangePlayer-Pro/releases) and run it.

### Dependencies

You need `Java 1.8` and newer to run the StrangePlayer Pro

### Bugs and bad design

There is a lot of bugs, feel free to write them to [Issues](https://github.com/WellThatsStrange-Studios/StrangePlayer-Pro/issues).

Also the design is awful, I’ll work on that later.

### Contributions

Feel free to contribute to this project, but:

- Make sure the changes **actually work**
- Carefully describe what does the change work and how does it work
- The code has to look good

*This project is a joke, don’t take it seriously.
